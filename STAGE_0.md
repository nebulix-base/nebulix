# Nebulix (NBX) — Stage 0 Status

Nebulix (NBX) is a Base-native ERC-20 token currently in **Stage 0**, an early experimental phase focused on observing on-chain liquidity behavior and protocol mechanics.

## V1 → V2 Migration
Nebulix v1 was an early mechanics test and has now been fully burned.

NBX v2 is a clean Base-native ERC-20 implementation using OpenZeppelin standards, with:
- Fixed supply
- No transfer taxes
- No minting
- No rebasing
- Fully verified contract on BaseScan

## Liquidity
Liquidity is intentionally small and owner-provided.  
Stage 0 liquidity exists solely for testing swaps, price impact, and Uniswap v3 range behavior.

This is **not a launch**, **not a sale**, and **not a promotion phase**.

## Sales
There has been:
- No ICO
- No IEO
- No private sale
- No seed round
- No token distribution event

## Purpose
Stage 0 is designed to gather real on-chain data before any further development phases are considered.
